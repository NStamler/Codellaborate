# Codellaborate
Codellaborate is a multi-user collaborative web-based application to edit and save code that I created with two friends at StuyHacks Spring 2016. There is no login required, but files still remain private since they can only be accessed via randomly-generated link that is sent to the users. This project was built with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, integrating the Firepad API for the textarea, TogetherJS for the chat and link sharing, and Bootstrap for the formatting of the document storage page.
